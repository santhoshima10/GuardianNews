This is my News App built for Udacity Student edition.

This app contains:

Navigation Drawer for Listing the various news sections of The Guardian
Used Fragments to show various news section list view
Used Loaders for making network requests to the Guardian API
Used Async Task to load images from the News API for the purpose of native code (Picasa library can also be used and its much better and faster)
